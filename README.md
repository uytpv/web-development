## About The Project

[Task 1: HTML tagsAssignment](https://github.com/uytpv/web-development/tree/main/HTML/task_1)

Create an HTML tutorial page that introduces you to the basic structure of an HTML page and the tags it requires to stack.
Introduce at least the following tags:
\<HTML\>
\<HEAD\>
\<BODY\>
\<P\>
\<IMG\>
\<A\>
\<BR\>
\<H1\> and other H tags
To build the page, use the HTML features introduced so far in the course. Headings, paragraphs of text, lists, tables and so on. You can also add links to content elsewhere.
The exercise is returned to Moodle as an HTML-file.
